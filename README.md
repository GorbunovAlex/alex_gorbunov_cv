# alex_gorbunov_cv

Hello, everyone! My name is Alex Gorbunov and this is my CV.

## TechStack

Tech stack was chosen just to be as simple as possible. I'm fond of Go, that's why I've used it with a pinch of LLM generated HTML and CSS.

## The idea

The idea is simple: show projects that I've created on freelance and, of course, partially get rid of pdf CVs :D
